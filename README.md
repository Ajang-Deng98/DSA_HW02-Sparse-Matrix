# Sparse Matrix Asignment
This repository houses the code for implementing fundamental mathematical operations on sparse matrices, including addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Designed for a Data Structures and Algorithms course, this project offers a practical exploration of sparse matrix manipulation techniques.

# To access the directory 
1. /sample_inputs/easy_sample_02_3.txt Contain the sample of the inputs.
2. /sample_inputs/easy_sample_01_3.txt Contain the sample of the inputs.
3. /dsa_spare_matrix/main.py  Contain the python codes.

Use the following command to run the codes and see the output.

python3 /DSA_HW02-Sparse-Matrix/sparse_matrix/main.py
python3 /DSA_HW02-Sparse-Matrix/sparse_matrix/sparse_matrix.py
